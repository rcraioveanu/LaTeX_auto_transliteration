# Automatic transliteration in XeLaTeX

This repository provides a set of mappings of ASCII characters to non-Roman writing systems, allowing the user to type in the Roman alphabet and have the compiled output rendered in another writing system. This may be useful to reduce errors in writing systems the user is not very familiar with, or simply as a workaround for poor editor or OS rendering of the writing system.

Note that this transliteration requires use of the `fontspec` package, and therefore requires use of XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX.
